# python-library-template
Template for a Python library that supports data science projects. Setup uses `poetry`.

## Setup

Initialize poetry.
```
poetry install
```

Run Jupyter Lab.
```
poetry run jupyter lab
```

Run tests.
```
poetry run pytest
```


## Next Steps
- Drop datasets or exploratory files into `notebooks/`
- Turn notebook functions into reusable modules in `src/my_data_toolkit/`
- Add more tests in `tests/`
- Use `poetry build` and `poetry publish` when you're ready to share
